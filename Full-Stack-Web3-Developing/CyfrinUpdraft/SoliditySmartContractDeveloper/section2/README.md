# Cyfrin Updraft - Section 2 Learnings  

In the second section of **Cyfrin Updraft (Solidity 101: Storage Factory)**, I learned how to create and interact with multiple smart contracts using the factory pattern in Solidity.  


##  Solidity Concepts  
- **Factory Pattern:** creating multiple contracts from a single parent contract  
- **Importing Contracts:** learning how to import one Solidity file into another  
- **Composability:** combining contracts to build modular systems  
- **`new` Keyword:** deploying new contracts from within another contract  
- **Interacting with Other Contracts:** using **ABI + address** to call external contracts  
- **Inheritance:** reusing code from parent contracts  
- **Override & Virtual Keywords:** customizing inherited functions  

##  Key Takeaways  
- Learned how to make contracts interact with each other  
- Understood contract composability and code reusability  
- Practiced inheritance and function overriding  
- Gained experience deploying and managing multiple contracts through a factory
