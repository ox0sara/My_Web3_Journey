# Cyfrin Updraft - Section 3 Learnings  

In **Section 3 of Cyfrin Updraft (Solidity 101: Fund Me)**, I built a decentralized crowdfunding smart contract that allows users to fund with ETH and lets the owner withdraw funds. I also learned about price feeds, contract interaction, and deployment to zkSync.


##  Solidity Concepts  
- **FundMe Contract:** decentralized crowdfunding using native blockchain currency  
- **Require Statements & Payable Functions:** validating transactions and accepting ETH  
- **Oracles & Chainlink:** fetching real-world price data for ETH/USD conversion  
- **Interfaces:** interacting with external contracts (AggregatorV3Interface)  
- **Libraries:** creating custom libraries and using SafeMath  
- **Mappings & Arrays:** tracking funders and amounts sent  
- **For Loops:** iterating over arrays and resetting mappings  
- **Constructor & Modifiers:** assigning contract owner and restricting functions  
- **Send, Transfer, and Call:** three methods of sending ETH from a contract  
- **Constants & Immutables:** improving gas efficiency  
- **Custom Errors:** optimized error handling  
- **Receive & Fallback Functions:** handling ETH sent directly to the contract  
- **Deploying to zkSync Testnet:** deploying FundMe to Layer 2 (zkSync Sepolia)  

##  Key Takeaways  
- Built a complete decentralized funding contract from scratch  
- Learned how to integrate Chainlink price feeds  
- Gained a deeper understanding of gas efficiency and contract security  
- Practiced deploying and testing smart contracts on testnets
