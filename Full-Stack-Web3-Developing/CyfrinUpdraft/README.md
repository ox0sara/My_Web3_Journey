# Cyfrin Updraft Solidity 101 - Learning Journey

This repository contains my notes and projects from the **Cyfrin Updraft Solidity 101** course, covering Sections 1 to 4. I went through the course to refresh and strengthen my understanding of Solidity and smart contract development.

## Sections Overview

### Section 1: Simple Storage
- Learned the basics of Solidity: data types, functions, arrays, and structs.
- Practiced writing, compiling, and deploying a simple contract using Remix.

### Section 2: Storage Factory
- Explored the factory pattern for creating multiple contracts.
- Learned to import contracts, use inheritance, and override functions.
- Gained understanding of composability and modular contract design.

### Section 3: Fund Me
- Built a decentralized crowdfunding contract.
- Worked with ETH transactions, Chainlink price feeds, interfaces, libraries, constants, modifiers, custom errors, and receive/fallback functions.
- Deployed the contract on zkSync testnet.

### Section 4: AI Prompting
- Learned to use AI tools for debugging and research.
- Practiced asking clear, targeted questions and leveraging GitHub and developer communities.
- Improved problem-solving and independent learning in smart contract development.

## Key Takeaways
- Gained a solid foundation in writing and deploying Solidity contracts.
- Learned contract interaction, data storage patterns, and error handling.
- Enhanced understanding of blockchain development and Layer 2 deployment.
