# Dev3pck - Section 2 Learnings  

In the second section of **Solidity 101: Storage Factory**, I learned how to create and interact with multiple smart contracts using the factory pattern in Solidity.  

---

##  Solidity Concepts  
- **Factory Pattern:** Creating multiple contracts from a single parent contract.  
- **Importing Contracts:** Learning how to import one Solidity file into another.  
- **Composability:** Combining contracts to build modular and scalable systems.  
- **`new` Keyword:** Deploying new contracts from within another contract.  
- **Interacting with Other Contracts:** Using **ABI + address** to call external contracts.  
- **Inheritance:** Reusing code from parent contracts to reduce duplication.  
- **`override` & `virtual` Keywords:** Customizing inherited functions.  

---

##  Key Takeaways  
- Learned how to make contracts interact with each other.  
- Understood contract composability and code reusability.  
- Practiced inheritance and function overriding.  
- Gained experience deploying and managing multiple contracts through a factory.
