# Dev3pck - Session 1 Learnings

In the first session of Dev3pck, I started learning Solidity and got familiar with the basics of smart contract development. Here is a summary of what I learned:

##  Solidity Basics
- **Features of Solidity:** Understanding the core capabilities of the language for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Data Types and Functions:** Learning how to declare variables, use different data types, and create functions.
- **Arrays and Structs:** Managing collections of data and creating custom data structures.
- **Writing, Compiling, and Deploying Contracts:** Step-by-step process to write a smart contract, compile it, and deploy it to a blockchain.

##  Key Takeaways
- Solidity is a statically-typed language designed for smart contracts.
- Structs allow grouping of related data in a single entity.
- Arrays can store multiple values of the same type.
- Deployment involves compiling the contract and sending it to a blockchain network.
